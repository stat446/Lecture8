## Cluster Sampling and Systematic Sampling

In general, we want the target and study populations to be the same. When they are not the same, the researcher must be careful to ensure that conclusions based on the sample results can still be applied to the target population.
\vfill

Because of restrictions such as cost or scheduling conflicts, it is often impossible to collect a simple random sample or a stratified random sample. In many cases, however, it may be possible to define a sampling frame with sampling units that _are not_ the units in the target population or the study population, yet still obtain statistically valid estimates.
\vfill

__Cluster sampling__ is an example of when *a difference between the target population and the sampling frame occurs. Despite the difference, if executed properly, conclusions based on the sample results from these sampling designs can be applied to the target population.*
\vfill

Example. Suppose MSU wants to determine whether students would a fall break during October or to finish classes later in December. A set of 50 classes are randomly selected and students within those classes record their choice.
\vfill

A population contains *$M_0$ population units. The set of $M_0$ units is partioned into $N$ disjoint groups of population units called primary sample units (PSUs). The population units contained in the primary sampling units are called secondary sampling units (SSUs).*
\vfill

In this example the PSUs are the classes and the SSUs are the students within the classes.
\vfill

The primary sampling units may be of different sizes. That is, the numbers of secondary sampling units in the primary units are not all the same.
\vfill

Think of these disjoint groups of population units (clusters) in a similar fashion to strata. Then suppose we define the sampling frame as a set of clusters Then, the sampling units in this population are not individual units in the population.
\vfill

The sampling units are _clusters_ of population units. *In this case, the sampling frame does not correspond with the units of the target population or the study population.*
\vfill

Note: the population has $M_0$ individual units, but the sampling frame only has $N$ PSU corresponding to the number of clusters formed. *The responses from the secondary sampling units are not analyzed individually, but are combined with all other secondary sampling units that are in the same cluster. Therefore, there are $N$ possible $y$ values (not $M_0$).*
\vfill

Very often, all of the secondary sampling units in each selected primary sampling unit will also be included in the sample. *This is one-stage cluster sampling and will be studied first.*

#### Cluster Sampling Notation

Similar to stratified random sampling, let $y_{ij}$ denote the response of SSU $j$ within cluster $i$.
\vfill

##### Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) level

- $N=$ the number of clusters (PSUs) in the population
\vfill

- $M_i=$ *the number of secondary sampling units (SSUs) in cluster $i$*
\vfill

- $M_0 = \sum_{i=1}^N M_i =$ *the total number of SSUs in the population*
\vfill

- $t_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} y_{ij} =$ cluster $i$ total
\vfill

- $t = \sum_{i=1}^N t_i = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} y_{ij} =$ population total
\vfill

- $\bar{t} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^n t_i =$ mean of the cluster totals (mean of PSU values).
\vfill

- $S^2_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (t_i - \bar{t})^2}{N-1}$ the population variance of cluster totals

\newpage

##### Secondary Sampling Unit (SSU) level

$\bar{y}_U = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} \frac{y_{ij}}{M_0} = \frac{t}{M_0}$ the population mean
\vfill

$\bar{y}_{iU} = \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} \frac{y_{ij}}{M_i} = \frac{t_i}{M_i} =$ population mean in PSU $i$
\vfill

$S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} \frac{(y_{ij} - \bar{y}_U)^2}{M_0 - 1} =$ population variance of SSUs
\vfill

$S_i^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} \frac{(y_{ij} - \bar{y}_{iU})^2}{M_i - 1} =$ population variance within PSU $i$

##### Sample Values
$n =$ the number of *PSUs (clusters) in the sample*
\vfill

$m_i=$ number of *SSUs in sampled PSU $i$ ($m_i \leq M_i$)*
\vfill

$\hat{\bar{y}}_i = \frac{1}{m_i} \sum_{j=1}^{m_i} y_{ij} =$ *mean of the sampled SSUs in sampled PSU $i$*
\vfill

$\hat{t}_i = \frac{M_i}{m_i} \sum_{j=1}^{m_i} y_{ij} =$ *estimated total of the SSUs in sampled PSU $i$*
\vfill

$\hat{t}_{cl} = \frac{N}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{t}_i$ = *unbiased estimator of population total $t$*
\vfill

$s_t^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (t_i - \frac{\hat{t}_{cl}}{N})^2}{n-1} =$ the sample variance of estimated cluster (PSU) totals
\vfill

$s_i^2 \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{m_i}(y_{ij} - \bar{y}_i)^2}{m_i -1} =$ the sample variance within PSU $i$
\vfill

$w_{ij} =$ sampling weight for SSU $j$ in PSU $i$
\vfill

	
Note in one-stage cluster samping, we have $m_i= M_i$. That is, every SSU in PSU $i$ is sampled. Thus $\bar{y}_i = \hat{\bar{y}}_i$, $t_i = \hat{t}_i$, and $S_i^2 = s_i^2$ when $m_i = M_i$.

#### One-Stage Cluster Sampling

When the strata themselves are the primary sampling units, the strata are called clusters. The selection of a sample of clusters to provide a sample of population units *is called cluster sampling.*
\vfill

If all of the population units in every selected cluster are in the sample, *then this is known as one-stage cluster sampling.*
\vfill

What is the difference between one-stage cluster sampling and stratified random sampling?

- In stratified SRS, *we take a SRS of population sampling units within each stratum to form the sample.*
\vfill

- In one-stage cluster sampling, *we take a subset of strata as the primary sampling units (PSUs) and then sample every SSU with each selected PSU.*
\vfill

When a cluster is defined as a group of population units, the clusters are called the primary sampling units. Subgroups within primary sample units are called secondary sampling units. For one-stage cluster sampling, the secondary sampling units are the individual units.
\vfill

If the selection of the population units within every selected cluster is restricted a second time, then this technique is known as subsampling or two-stage cluster sampling. *For example, we may take a SRS of secondary sampling units within each primary sampling unit. This will be discussed in more detail later.*
\vfill

If a sample of primary sampling units (Stage 1) is selected, followed by a selection of secondary sampling units (Stage 2) within the sample of primary sampling units, followed by a selection of tertiary sampling units (Stage 3) within the sample of secondary sampling units, and so on, then the sampling procedure is known as multistage cluster sampling.
\vfill

In cluster sampling, the size of the cluster can also be used as an auxilarly variable to select clusters with unequal sampling probabilities (more later) or used in a ratio estimator.
\vfill

Stratified sampling vs. cluster sampling:

- *A researcher will use a stratified samplig design because of its potential to produce and efficient (less variable) estimator of a population characteristic.* It will, in general, be more expensive to collect data for a stratified sample than for a cluster sample.
\vfill

- *A researcher will use cluster sampling because of its administrative convenience. That is, cluster sampling can significantly reduce sampling costs often at the expense of a less efficient estimator of a population characteristic.*

##### Estimation of $\bar{y}_U, t,$ and $\bar{t}$.

The unbiased estimator of $t$ is:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	*\hat{t}_{cl} &=& \frac{N}{n} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{S}_i } y_{ij} = \frac{N}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n t_i =  \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{S}_i } w_{ij} y_{ij}* \\
	\end{eqnarray*}
where $i \in \mathcal{S}$ corresponds to the PSUs selected in the sample $\mathcal{S},$ $j \in \mathcal{S}_i$ corresponds to the SSUs selected in the sample for PSUs $j$ ($\mathcal{S}_j$), and $w_{ij}$ is the weight associated with probability of selection $\frac{N}{n}$ in this case.
\vfill

The unbiased estimators of $\bar{y}_U$ is:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	*\hat{\bar{y}}_{cl} &=&  \frac{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} t_i}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} M_i} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} M_i \bar{y}_i}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} M_i},*
	\end{eqnarray*}
where $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n t_i = \frac{\hat{t}_{cl}}{N}$ is the sample mean of the cluster totals.
\vfill

Next we want to study the standard error of these estimators:
	\begin{equation*}
	SE(\hat{t}_{cl}) = N\sqrt{(1-\frac{n}{N}) \frac{S_t^2}{n}} 
	\end{equation*}
	where $S_t^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (t_i - \bar{t})^2}{N-1}$ is the variance of the $N$ cluster $t_i$ totals. 
\vfill



Because $S^2_t$ is unknown, the sample variance of the cluster totals is used:
	\begin{equation*}
	s_t^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (t_i - \frac{\hat{t}_{cl}}{N})^2}{n-1}.
	\end{equation*}
\vfill

The square root of the estimated variances using $s_t^2$ returns the standard errors of the estimators.
\vfill

The standard error for the population mean is actually calculated using ratio estimation (similar to domain estimation)
	\begin{equation*}
	SE(\hat{\bar{y}}_{cl}) = \sqrt{\left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right) \frac{1}{n \bar{M}^2} \frac{\sum{i \in \mathcal{S}} \left(t_i - \hat{\bar{y}}_{cl} M_i \right)^2}{n-1}} 
	\end{equation*}
	where $S_t^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (t_i - \bar{t})^2}{N-1}$ is the variance of the $N$ cluster $t_i$ totals. 
\vfill

Confidence intervals follow the usual prescription, but note that the degrees of freedom for the $t$ critical values are based on the the number of primary sampling units, or clusters, and not the total number of secondary sampling units.
	
\newpage

#### Comparison to SRS

Because the variance formulas for $\hat{\bar{y}}_{U,cl}$ and $\hat{t}_{cl}$ are determined only from the cluster-to-cluster variability, the precision of the estimators can be improved if *clusters can be formed with small cluster-to-cluster variability.*
\vfill

Q: How does this compare to the strategy for choosing strata?
\vfill


We want clusters such that the variability of the SSU $y-$values within each cluster *is as large as possible but the variability of the $t_i$ values across clusters is as small as possible.*
\vfill

This is in *contrast to stratified SRS for which we want strata such that variability within each stratum is as small as possible but the variability across strata is as large as possible*.*
\vfill

Example. Suppose we are interested in salaries of past MSU graduates. Devise a stratified random sampling scheme and a cluster sampling scheme. 
\vfill
\vfill

For comparison sake, assume we took a SRS with $n \times M$ samples. The variance of the estimated total would be:
	\begin{equation}
	V(\hat{t}_{SRS}) = N^2 (1-\frac{n}{N}) \frac{M S^2}{n}.
	\end{equation}
	Recall the variance of the cluster sampling estimate of the population total was:
	\begin{equation}
	V(\hat{t}_{cl}) = N^2 (1-\frac{n}{N}) \frac{S_t^2}{n},
	\end{equation}
	where $S_t^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(t_i - \bar{t})^2}{N-1} = M (MSB)$. MSB is the mean square of the between cluster variability. 

\vfill
So if $MSB > S^2$ then cluster sampling is less efficient than SRS.

\newpage

#### Systematic Sampling
Systematic Sampling is a sampling plan in which the population units are collected systematically throughout the population. More specifically, a single primary sampling unit consists of secondary sampling units that are relatively spaced with each other in the systematic pattern throughout the population.
\vfill

Suppose the study area is partioned into a $20 \times 20$ grid of 400 population units. A primary sampling unit in a systematic sample could consist of all population units that occur in every 5 units..
\vfill

Initially, systematic sampling and cluster sampling appear to be opposites because systematic samples contain secondary sampling units that are spread *throughout the population (good global coverage of the study area) while cluster samples are collected in groups of close proximity (good coverage locally within the study area).*
\vfill

Systematic and cluster sampling are similar, however, because whenever a primary sampling unit is selected from the sampling frame, all secondary sampling units of that primary sampling unit will be included in the sample. Thus, random selection occurs at the primary sampling unit level and not the secondary sampling unit level.
\vfill

For estimation purposes, you could ignore the secondary sampling unit $y_{ij}-$values and only retain the primary sampling units $t_i-$values. This is what we did with one-stage cluster sampling.
\vfill

The systematic and cluster sampling principle: How do we obtain low variance?
\vfill

*To obtain estimators of low variance, the population must be partitioned into primary sampling unit clusters in such a say that the clusters are similar to each other with respect to the $t_i-$ values (small cluster-to-cluster variability.)*
\vfill

This is equivalent to saying that the within-cluster variablity should be as large as possible to obtain the most precise estimators. Thus, the ideal primary sampling unit is representative of the full diversity of $y_{ij}$ values within the population.
\vfill

With natural populations of spatially distributed plants, animals, minerals, ect., *these conditions are typicaly satisfied by systematic primary sampling units (and are not satisfied by primary sampling units with spatially clustered secondary sampling units.)*


### Estimation of $\bar{y}_U$ and $t$

If a SRS is used to select the systematic primary sampling units, we can apply the estimation results for cluster sampling to define (i) estimators, (ii) the variance of each estimator, and (iii) the estimated variance of each estimator.
